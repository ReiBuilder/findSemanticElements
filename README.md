## Introduction
FindSemEle is a tool to find fine grain semantic element from electronic dictionary.
The "fine grain semantic element" is defined on a new semantic theory which different from all other theories existing now.
The theory I called SSAE inspired by Embodied cognition and a view that consider cognition system as a prediction-comparison system.

Anyone who read files in Extracted and have interests at SSAE, can contact me for further discussion.

1. **Attribute** these conception often link to information which be received by sensory perception of human. for example, conception like "red", "big", "loud" or "strong".

2. **Relation** the relationship between two (or more) objects In a broad sense.
3. **Action**
