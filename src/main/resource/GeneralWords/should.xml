The nationalistic statements of 18th and 19th century British grammarians, who commonly cited the misuses of the Irish, the Scots, and occasionally the Americans, suggest that the traditional rules may have come closest to the usage of southern England. Some modern commentators believe that English usage is still the closest to the traditionally prescribed norms. Most modern commentators allow that <it>will</it> is more common in nearly all uses. The entries for <it>shall</it> and <it>will</it> in this dictionary show current usage.</pt></entry>
