Not <it>hardly</it></vi>. In sense 4b with a negative verb (as <it>can't, wouldn't, didn't</it>) it does not make a double negative but softens the negative. In “you can't hardly find a red one,” the sense is that you can find a red one, but only with difficulty; in “you can't find a red one,” the sense is that red ones are simply not available. Use of <it>hardly</it> with a negative verb is a speech form; it is most commonly heard in Southern and Midland speech areas. In other speech areas and in all discursive prose, <it>hardly</it> is normally used with a positive <vi>you can <it>hardly</it> find a red one</vi>.</pt></entry>
